# openHop Modem — USB/TCP LoRa modem for openHop Core

Firmware that turns a supported ESP32 or nRF52 board with an SX1262
front end into a dedicated LoRa modem controlled by an openHop Core host
over USB-CDC, Wi-Fi/TCP, or (on boards with native Ethernet) wired LAN.
The transport is host-platform agnostic; platform support depends on the
openHop application and its access to USB or the modem's network.

**Supported boards** (one source tree, picked at compile time via
`-DBOARD_<name>` in `platformio.ini`):

openHop Core connects to the modem through `USBLoRaRadio` or
`TCPLoRaRadio`. Routing, encryption, retransmission, and other MeshCore
logic stay on the host; the modem handles the SX1262 physical layer:
TX, RX, CAD, and LoRa parameter configuration.

The host can be any platform supported by the openHop application and
its USB or network transport. Wi-Fi is available on supported ESP32
boards; wired Ethernet is available on P4-Nano, EtherMesh-1W, and the
RAK4631 WisMesh Ethernet target. T114, RAK4631 USB, RAK3401, and XIAO nRF52
Wio use USB-CDC only.

- **USB mode** — cable, instant, no provisioning; ideal for single-board setups.
- **Network TCP mode** — Wi-Fi/TCP on ESP32 boards, or Ethernet/TCP on wired
  targets (P4-Nano, EtherMesh-1W, RAK4631). Wi-Fi boards are provisioned via AP portal
  (`openHop-Modem-XXXX` → `http://192.168.4.1`), USB, or their web UI; the TCP
  token defaults blank/open on fresh firmware and can be set from the web UI on
  web-enabled builds. The RAK4631 Ethernet variant provides a LAN-only,
  authenticated WebUI and JSON/config API on port 80. It has no mDNS; discover
  its IP from DHCP or configure a static address. WebUI firmware upload over
  Ethernet is disabled because safe staged activation and recovery would
  require a custom openHop Modem bootloader, which is not currently planned.
  Deployed gateways can still be updated OTA through the working Bluetooth DFU
  flow using the generated nRF52 `firmware.zip`.

## Project layout

- **`firmware/`** — PlatformIO tree, twenty environments sharing one source.
  Each board lives in `include/boards/<env>.h`; `platformio.ini` picks
  one via `-DBOARD_<NAME>`. Prebuilt artifacts (ESP32: combined
  `firmware.factory.bin` plus `bootloader.bin / partitions.bin / firmware.bin`;
  nRF52: `firmware.hex`, Adafruit DFU `firmware.zip`, and UF2 where supported)
  live in `firmware/<env>/`.
- **`.github/workflows/`** — firmware validation, asset staging, and release
  packaging. Repeater packaging and modem transport drivers live in the
  openHop Repeater and openHop Core repositories, not here.

## Installation

Flash supported boards from the browser at <https://flasher.openhop.dev/>.
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) also covers local esptool/PlatformIO flashing,
network OTA, Wi-Fi provisioning, and selecting the built-in `modem_usb` or
`modem_tcp` transport in openHop Repeater. No driver copying, Repeater patching,
or modem-specific container image is required.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [itk80](https://github.com/itk80) (KeenKJ), whose early
firmware, modem-driver, integration, and hardware-support work laid the
groundwork that became openHop Modem. Without his work, this project would
not exist.

## Firmware asset builds

The `Build Firmware Assets` GitHub workflow uses
`firmware/tools/build_firmware_assets.py` to build PlatformIO envs and stage
flasher-ready outputs in `firmware/<env>/`.  Pull requests do not build
firmware.  Pushes to `main` build affected envs and open an asset-update PR
containing updated `firmware/<env>/` binaries, manifests, and SHA256 sums
without uploading Actions artifacts.  Manual dispatch can build `auto`, `all`,
or specific envs from any branch; manual runs upload Actions artifacts for
review and only commit generated files when `commit_artifacts=true`.

## Per-board pin map

All board-specific GPIOs and policies live in
`firmware/include/boards/<name>.h` — pick the closest existing one
when adding a new carrier and edit the few fields that differ.

Per-board highlights (full pin numbers in the headers, mDNS prefix is
`BoardConfig.mdns_prefix`, hostname `<prefix>-<mac3>.local`):

- **Heltec V3** — onboard SSD1306, bare SX1262, max 22 dBm.
- **Heltec V4** — onboard SSD1306, SX1262 + V4.x PA/LNA front-end, native USB-CDC, max 22 dBm SX1262 command power.
- **Heltec V4.2** — dedicated GC1109 PA/FEM build with VFEM/CSD enabled and GC1109 CPS driven high for full PA mode.
- **Heltec V4.3** — dedicated KCT8103L PA/FEM build with SX1262 boosted RX gain enabled and FEM RX LNA bypassed by default for lower noise floor; the device web UI can toggle the external FEM RX LNA and set `agc.reset.interval` for periodic RX AGC resets during long idle periods.
- **Heltec Wireless Tracker V2** — ESP32-S3 + SX1262 + KCT8103L PA/FEM, ST7735 TFT 160×80, native USB-CDC, max 22 dBm SX1262 command power.
- **Ikoka Stick** — XIAO ESP32-S3 + E22P868M30S, EN-held + DIO2-as-RF-switch, max 30 dBm chip / +10 dB PA, external OLED.
- **XIAO Wio-SX1262** — Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 + bare SX1262, no OLED.
- **MeshSmith Photon-1W ESP32-C6** — Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6 + Photon 1 W SX1262/E22P class front end, Photon XIAO pinout (D1 DIO1, D2 reset, D3 busy, D4 NSS, D5 RXEN, D8/D9/D10 SPI), Wi-Fi/TCP + AP provisioning + web UI/stats/OTA.
- **LilyGO T3-S3** — bare SX1262 + onboard SSD1306, native USB-CDC.
- **LilyGO T-Beam-S3 Supreme** — bare SX1262 + onboard L76K GNSS + 1.3" SH1106 OLED, native USB-CDC. LoRa/GNSS/OLED power rails are gated by an onboard AXP2101 PMU chip (`pmu_manager.cpp` / `BoardConfig.pmu`) on its own I2C bus rather than plain GPIOs — the only board in this fleet wired that way.
- **RAK3112 WisMesh** — SX1262 inside the RAK3112 module, no OLED.
- **Station G2** — SX1262 + high-power PA/LNA, SH1106 display, max SX1262 drive capped at 19 dBm.
- **Station G3** — BQESP32V1M N16R8 (16 MB flash + 8 MB octal PSRAM) + BQ35LORA900V1M, Station G2-compatible radio/display pins, persistent Station G3-only web/API selection of lower or higher PA PL1 mode on GPIO9 (lower by default), persistent RX-only external LNA enable/bypass on GPIO10, onboard INA219 input-voltage/current/power telemetry with since-boot minimum voltage and maximum current, optional GROVE GPS on IO7/IO15, and max SX1262 drive capped at 19 dBm. The LNA is always bypassed before TX and during periodic AGC maintenance. Remove the PA PL1/LNA P jumpers for software GPIO control; PA PL2 remains a physical jumper.

Station G2 and G3 can experience a reported SX1262 receiver failure mode in
which the apparent noise floor rises by roughly 20–30 dB and packet reception
stops until the radio is reinitialized. The optional workaround calls
RadioLib's `resetAGC()` during idle RX, then resumes continuous receive. Resets
are deferred during TX, standby, detected packet reception, and for 10 seconds
after a Station transmits so maintenance cannot interrupt the usual repeater
forwarding/response window. Each reset still creates a brief listening gap, so
periodic maintenance is disabled by default. Set `agc_reset_interval_sec` to
`4` in `/api/config` to enable the recommended four-second interval; changes
apply immediately without rebooting the modem, and `0` disables the workaround.
- **WaveShare ESP32-P4-Nano** — RISC-V P4 + C6 + IP101GRI Ethernet PHY + off-board E22, runtime ETH-or-Wi-Fi (never both, see below).
- **Heltec T114** — nRF52840 + bare SX1262 + ST7789 TFT 135×240, **no Wi-Fi/TCP/network OTA**; USB-CDC + UART transport only, OTA via Adafruit nRF52 DFU (USB) or in-app `CMD_OTA_*` over the protocol transport.
- **RAK4631 USB** — RAK4631 nRF52840 core on a compatible WisBlock base, using the same proven internal SX1262 pins, DIO2 RF-switch policy, SPIM2 radio bus, and 22 dBm ceiling as the Ethernet build. The `rak4631_usb` environment omits the RAK13800 dependency and all W5100S/TCP/network initialization; native USB-CDC is the only modem transport.
- **RAK4631 WisMesh Ethernet** — RAK4631 nRF52840 core module + RAK13800 W5100S Ethernet on the WisBlock IO slot. It has its own PlatformIO board JSON and product-specific variant under `firmware/variants/RAK4631_WisMesh_Ethernet/`, separate SPIM instances for Ethernet (SPIM3) and LoRa (SPIM2), no display, and no Wi-Fi. TCP port 5055 is the primary transport; USB-CDC is the fallback. Port 80 serves the authenticated WebUI/config API. WebUI firmware upload over Ethernet is disabled because safe staged activation and recovery would require a custom openHop Modem bootloader, which is not currently planned. Deployed gateways remain OTA-updatable through the working Bluetooth DFU flow using the generated nRF52 `firmware.zip`; generated `firmware.ota` files are non-installable staging artifacts. The WebUI/API persist hostname, DHCP/static network values, TCP port/token, HTTP password, and compile-gated GPS state without echoing secret values. The default HTTP login is `admin` / `openhop`; change both the HTTP password and blank/open TCP token before trusting a shared LAN. The product USB descriptor is `WisMesh-openHop-Ethernet`; reselect any stale by-id serial path after flashing. Hardware validation covers W5100S TCP, the authenticated WebUI/config API, hostname and static-network persistence, automatic reboot and HTTP recovery after saves, and complete browser-initiated BLE DFU uploads.
- **RAK3401** — RAKwireless nRF52840 WisBlock core + RAK13302 LoRa module (SX1262 driving a Skyworks SKY66122-11 front end, ~1 W). Ported from the MeshCore `rak3401` variant: unlike the RAK4631 targets the SX1262 sits on the WisBlock SPI slot (P0.03 SCK / P0.29 MISO / P0.30 MOSI / P0.26 NSS), not on the core module's internal bus. WB_IO2 (P0.34) gates the 3V3_S rail and the RAK13302's 5 V PA boost, WB_IO3 (P0.21) drives the SKY66122 CSD+CPS pair — both held HIGH for the life of the device — and SX1262 DIO2 drives CTX so TX/RX switching is hardware-timed. SX1262 drive is capped at 22 dBm into the PA, with the 0x08B5 sensitivity patch and boosted RX gain enabled. LiPo voltage is read from P0.05 through a 1.73:1 divider. **No Wi-Fi/TCP/network OTA**, no display; native USB-CDC transport only, with firmware updates through the Adafruit nRF52 USB bootloader using DFU or UF2 assets.
- **Seeed XIAO nRF52840 + Wio-SX1262** (SKU 102010710) — XIAO nRF52840 + bare SX1262 on the Wio-SX1262 carrier, BLE 5.0 hardware unused, **no Wi-Fi/TCP/network OTA**, no display; native USB-CDC transport only, OTA via Adafruit nRF52 DFU (UF2 disk on double-click reset) or in-app `CMD_OTA_*`.

RAK4631 battery reporting uses the source-backed `WB_A0` mapping
(P0.05/AIN3), the nRF52 3.0 V internal ADC reference, 12-bit samples, eight
nonblocking samples per batch, and a 1.73 divider scale. The WebUI reports
voltage only; it does not infer charging state or state of charge. Real-board
calibration against a meter is still required.
The mapping was audited against MeshCore commit
`2228214ded57c2761312730cdeae14b2b31bc5a3`,
`variants/rak4631/RAK4631Board.h`, plus the official RAK nRF52 variant.

Optional serial NMEA GPS is compile-gated with
`PYMC_RAK4631_GPS_SERIAL_ENABLE=1` and uses Serial1 RX15/TX16 at 9600 baud.
No GPS power/reset GPIO is guessed, and ordinary builds do not poll GPS. The
RAK12500 I2C/slot-control mappings remain unimplemented until a safe base-board
slot is physically verified; Ethernet power/reset pins 34/21 are reserved and
must never be reused by GPS code.

### E22P RF switch (Ikoka, P4-Nano + E22P)

E22P truth table from the datasheet: `EN=1, T/R CTRL=1` → TX,
`EN=1, T/R CTRL=0` → RX, `EN=0` → off. Firmware drives `EN` LOW for
5 s at boot (LDO/PA settle), then HIGH for life. `T/R CTRL` is not
wired to the MCU — the carrier ties it to SX1262 DIO2, and firmware
enables `setDio2AsRfSwitch(true)` so SX1262 toggles it on TX
automatically. A board with two MCU-driven enable lines instead just
sets `rx_pin` / `tx_pin` in `RfSwitchPolicy`.

## Porting to another ESP32-P4 board

The WaveShare ESP32-P4-Nano is the reference; copy
`firmware/include/boards/esp32_p4_nano.h` and adjust pins. Quirks
that differ from the ESP32-S3 family:

- **GPIO35 is the boot strap** (not GPIO0). Many P4 boards wire their
  BOOT button there, but GPIO35 is also RMII TXD1 — when Ethernet is
  up, the EMAC drives it as a 25 MHz output and the button reads the
  bitstream. Set `pin_user_button = -1`; firmware then auto-cycles the
  OLED screens every 4 s instead.
- **High-numbered GPIOs (49+) sit on a separate LDO domain.** RMII
  TX_EN/CLK fall there but work on the Nano; if PHY init fails on a
  different carrier, suspect this first.
- **Wi-Fi (C6 SDIO) + Ethernet (RMII) + radio together is unstable** —
  the C6 esp_hosted bridge falls off the SDIO bus every ~25 s and the
  SoC's RTC watchdog reboots. Fix: leave both `has_wifi = true` and
  `ethernet.enabled = true` in the board header and let `setup()`
  pick at runtime — Ethernet is tried first, EMAC is torn down with
  `EthernetManager::end()` if there's no link, then Wi-Fi takes over.
  Either alone with the radio is fine; both at once isn't.
- **Ethernet** is configured via `BoardConfig::EthernetConfig`
  (MDC, MDIO, RST, addr, clock direction). Static-IP fields are
  optional — leave `use_static_ip = false` for DHCP. Add new PHY
  models by extending the `EthernetPhy` enum + the mapping in
  `ethernet_manager.cpp`.
- **Debug serial** — keep `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=0`; the
  pioarduino USB-Serial-JTAG path mangles `Serial.printf` output on
  ESP32-P4. Use the second USB-C port (CH343P → UART0) for printf
  debug, or rely on TCP / `CMD_GET_DEBUG`.
- **OLED is optional** — `pin_i2c_sda = -1` short-circuits the entire
  Wire/SSD1306 path.

## Network exposure: LAN-only by design

On Wi-Fi / Ethernet boards both TCP services — the protocol on 5055
and management/OTA HTTP on 80 where supported — refuse clients whose source address is outside
RFC1918 (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), link-local (`169.254/16`)
or loopback (`127/8`). The check runs at `accept()` time before any
frame parsing or auth. NAT port-forwards / Internet tunnels with a
public source IP are dropped unconditionally — TCP closes the socket,
OTA returns 403. Hard firmware policy; lifting it means editing
`firmware/include/net_filter.h` and re-flashing. Operators who need
remote access run a VPN whose tunnel address (WireGuard / Tailscale
in 100.64/10 → Tailscale subnet route, or any `10/8` overlay) is
inside the LAN range from the modem's point of view.

T114 has no IP stack at all — the only paths in are USB-CDC and the
secondary UART, and updates are either Adafruit DFU over USB or the
in-app `OTA_*` commands carried over the same transport.

### Wi-Fi outage recovery

Saved Wi-Fi connects asynchronously: USB/radio/main-loop work does not wait for
association or DHCP. Each attempt has a 30-second deadline, followed by retry
backoff of 5, 10, 20, 40 and then at most 60 seconds. Every third failed attempt
recreates **only the station interface**, with a 250 ms cooperative settling
interval. Arduino's reason-dependent automatic reconnect is disabled; its initial
one-time retry can still occur within the firmware deadline. Authentication
failure and lost-IP events therefore cannot leave the manager passively waiting
forever. Recovery neither erases credentials nor primarily relies on MCU reboot.
Driver API calls are still synchronous; this is a cooperative recovery policy,
not a hard real-time guarantee for the underlying Wi-Fi driver.

If the initial connection fails, the open `openHop-Modem-XXXX` setup AP stays
available while the saved network is retried in AP+STA mode. The setup HTTP server
checks each accepted socket's local address against the current nonzero AP IPv4
address before reading configuration, scanning, or saving changes, and requires
AP mode to remain enabled. STA, IPv6, and missing/stale local addresses are
rejected, independently of listener binding (the framework may wildcard-bind).
On STA success it is stopped/deleted and the AP is removed before normal
management HTTP/OTA starts. Failed AP startup
or shutdown is retried at five-second intervals. An empty configuration stays in
intentional setup mode without attempting STA. After the first successful STA
connection, later outages retry STA without opening a new unauthenticated portal.

Disconnect/stop/lost-IP events and address changes invalidate the old Wi-Fi TCP
session, including parser and authentication state, even when an outage completes
between loop polls. The next client must authenticate again when a token is set.
Sessions bound to a different interface address (Ethernet) and the wildcard TCP
and management listeners are not routinely restarted; an unchanged DHCP renewal
alone does not drop the client. The displayed IP follows the current usable STA
address (or the setup AP address), rather than retaining an obsolete lease.
Static/DHCP selection, hostname, antenna selection and the saved/default-on
Wi-Fi power-save policy are unchanged.

Host regression checks (C++17 compiler required):

```bash
python3 firmware/tools/test_wifi_recovery.py
```

These compile the production Wi-Fi manager, TCP server and frame parser with
recording hardware stubs, plus the complete production portal handlers and
extracted lifecycle functions. Portal admission tests deliberately use a wildcard
listener and exercise AP, STA, IPv6, missing/stale address, and disabled AP cases
on every route, checking rejected requests have no scan/configuration/RF effects.
They cover deadlines/backoff and timer wrap, failures and station restarts,
short event outages, address changes, AP setup/retry/teardown, and per-interface
TCP authentication/parser cleanup. They do **not** simulate the ESP32 driver,
prove RF/DHCP behavior or establish that a particular router/board's outage is
fixed. Hardware validation must still exercise multi-minute AP outages, wrong
credentials, DHCP expiry/address changes, HTTP/OTA and TCP recovery on the exact
board and firmware build.

### Web UI / OTA / JSON API authentication (v0.8+)

From v0.8 the HTTP surface (web management page, `/api/*` JSON endpoints,
and OTA `/update` on ESP builds) is gated by HTTP Basic Auth. Defaults on
first boot:

- **user:** `admin`
- **password:** `openhop`

Change the password via the **Change HTTP password** form in the web
UI; it is persisted in NVS under `http_pass`. ArduinoOTA (espota) uses
the same password as its `--auth` token. Examples:

```bash
# Open the web UI (browser)         → http://<host>/         (admin / openhop)
# Pull live stats                   → curl -u admin:openhop http://<host>/api/stats
# Flash a new firmware over HTTP    → curl -u admin:openhop \
#       -F firmware=@firmware/<env>/firmware.bin http://<host>/update
# Flash over espota via PlatformIO  → pio run -e <env> -t upload \
#       --upload-port <host> --upload-flags="--auth=openhop"
```

The RAK4631 stores its password in a CRC-protected, power-loss-safe dual-slot
record in bootloader-preserved nRF52 configuration pages rather than ESP NVS
or LittleFS. Its authenticated RAK-only **Bluetooth DFU** control hands off to
the installed Nordic BLE bootloader after the HTTP response is acknowledged and
the Ethernet socket is closed; a separate Nordic-compatible DFU app uploads the
nRF52 `firmware.zip`. The bootloader's Bluetooth name is not fixed. Complete BLE
DFU uploads are validated on the production gateway; keep USB serial DFU
available for interrupted-transfer recovery. This Bluetooth DFU flow is the
supported OTA update path for deployed gateways. Ethernet/WebUI `/update` and
staged activation remain disabled because they would require a custom openHop
Modem bootloader, which is not currently planned.
RAK JSON responses expose `tcp_token_set`, never the token.

Pre-v0.8 firmware used `heltec:<tcp_token>` on `/update` only — that
scheme is gone, the same credential pair now covers every HTTP path.

The RAK4631 staged writer is not connected to `CMD_OTA_*` or HTTP `/update`.
Those update commands and routes are disabled and unsupported on that target;
supporting safe staged activation and recovery would require a custom openHop
Modem bootloader, which is not currently planned. Use the generated
`firmware.zip` with the supported Bluetooth DFU OTA flow or USB DFU instead.

## Default radio parameters

Firmware boots into the MeshCore **EU Narrow / Switzerland** preset; the host
overrides these via `CMD_SET_CONFIG` at `begin()`:

| Parameter    | Value          |
|--------------|----------------|
| Frequency    | 869.618 MHz    |
| Bandwidth    | 62.5 kHz       |
| SF           | 8              |
| CR           | 4/8            |
| TX Power     | 22 dBm         |
| Sync Word    | 0x12 (private) |
| Preamble     | 16 symbols     |
| Header       | Explicit       |
| CRC          | CRC-8          |
| IQ           | Standard       |
| LDRO         | Auto           |

## On-device display

OLED boards (Heltec V3, Ikoka, LilyGO T3-S3) and the T114 TFT all run
the same screen state machine: boot splash for ≥5 s while `setup()`
runs in parallel, then **STATUS** (RX/TX, SSID/IP or USB-tag, state,
fw version) → **RADIO** (freq/SF/BW/CR/power/sync/preamble) →
**DIAGNOSTICS** (uptime, TCP client, USB idle, RX/TX/CRC). Short PRG
tap cycles them; the panel sleeps after 30 s of idle. Boards without
a usable button (P4-Nano, where BOOT shares GPIO35 with RMII TXD1)
auto-cycle every 4 s and never sleep.

Long PRG hold (≥3 s at boot) = factory reset (wipes Wi-Fi NVS,
reboots into AP portal on Wi-Fi boards). Without the button, use
`CMD_WIFI_RESET` or `esptool erase_flash`. T114 has no Wi-Fi NVS to
wipe — factory reset just clears the modem's persistent settings
(display name, auto-CAD flag) via the same flow.
